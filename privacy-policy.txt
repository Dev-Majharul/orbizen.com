I've created a comprehensive privacy policy tailored for Orbizen Limited as a global software company with operations in both the UK and Bangladesh. This policy:

1. Complies with UK data protection laws (GDPR/UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018)
2. Acknowledges Bangladesh's Digital Security Act 2018
3. Addresses global data protection standards
4. Includes sections on payment processing for various digital payment methods
5. Is appropriate for a new software company

The policy covers all essential elements including:
- Types of data collected
- How data is used and processed
- Legal bases for processing
- Data sharing practices
- International transfers
- Security measures
- User rights
- Retention policies
- Cookie usage
- Contact information

Remember to fill in the specific company addresses in section 15 before publishing. You may also want to have this policy reviewed by a legal professional familiar with data protection laws in both the UK and Bangladesh to ensure full compliance with all applicable regulations.
